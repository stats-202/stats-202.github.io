  <h2>Grade Breakdown</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="spanh">Four Homeworks:</span> 50 pts each</li>
      <li><span class="spanh">Take Home Midterm:</span> 100 pts</li>
      <li><span class="spanh">Final Exam:</span> 200 pts</li>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="spanh">Optional:</span> Final Project (200 pts)</li>
          <li>If both the Final Exam & Project are completed, we will take the max of the two scores, i.e. max(Final Exam, Final Project)</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
  <hr/>

  <h2>Collaboration Policy and Honor Code</h2>
  You are free to form study groups and discuss homeworks and projects. However, you must write up homeworks and code from scratch independently without referring to any notes from the joint session. Explicitly indicate with whom (if anyone) you discussed the homework problems (and what help they provided) at the top of your homework solutions. You should not copy, refer to, or look at the solutions in preparing their answers from previous years’ homeworks. It is an honor code violation to intentionally refer to a previous year’s solutions, either official or written up by another student. Anybody violating the honor code will be referred to the Office of Judicial Affairs.
  <hr/>
  <h2>Submission Instructions</h2>

  We will be using the <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/1049790">GradeScope</a> online submission system. All students (non-SCPD and SCPD) should submit their assignments electronically via GradeScope. Students can typeset or scan their homeworks. We will be using the auto-grader for the programming portions of the homeworks.<br><br>

  To register for GradeScope,

  <ul>
      <li>Create an account on GradeScope if you don’t have one already.
      <li>Here are some <a href="assets/files/submitting_hw_guide.pdf">helpful tips</a> for submitting through Gradescope.
  </ul>

  To allow students unfamiliar with Gradescope the ability to interact with it, an option test assignment titled "Homework 0" (with corresponding code) has been updated to the following locations:
  <ul>
      <li><a href="assets/hw/hw0.pdf">HW 0</a>
  </ul>

  <b>Written Assignments:</b> Homeworks should be individually written up clearly and succinctly; you may lose points if your answers are unclear or unnecessarily complicated. You are encouraged to use LaTeX to writeup your homeworks, but this is not a requirement. Explicitly indicate with whom (if anyone) you discussed the homework problems (and what help they provided) at the top of your homework solutions. Homework problems are similar to writing assignments in other courses in terms of citing sources and plagiarism. Students must cite (via URL or otherwise) sources used in preparing their homework solution.<br><br>
  <b>Late Homework:</b> All homework is due on 4:30 PM Pacific time on the due date. You have <b>2</b> late days which you can use at any time during the term without penalty. Once you run out of late days, late homework will be accepted with a 20% penalty. No assignment will be accepted more than two days after its due date. Each late homework should be clearly marked as "Late" on the first page. No late days are allowed for deadlines related to the course project or exams.<br><br>
  <b>Regrade Policy:</b> You may submit a regrade request if you believe that the course staff made an error in grading. Any regrade requests should be submitted through Gradescope within one week of receiving your grade. Please try to be as specific as possible with your regrade request. We will typically regrade the entirety of any homework for which any regrade is requested and the resulting score may be higher or lower than the original one.<br><br>
